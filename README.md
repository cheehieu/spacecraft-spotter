## Inspiration
This project was inspired by Intuitive Machine's Terrestrial Return Vehicle (TRV) TRaVeller spacecraft, and the suggested project statement to "let a user know if TRV is visible from their current location." The [TRV](https://intuitivemachines.com/Aerospace/SpaceSystems/) is an automated precision return vehicle, designed to deliver a scientific payload to a Low Earth Orbit (and beyond) and autonomously re-enter the Earth's atmosphere for a safe, precision landing.
